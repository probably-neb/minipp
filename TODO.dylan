1. All return paths to be valid
	Sidequest: To accomplish need to get the get type function to work
	A. ITerate through the statment listfor the functions and if they return to be valid then we can assume that this is tre. 
	when we hit a conditional we check its block, if there is an else we also check that members block. If both paths return we can return true.
	otherwise we check if it falls through
